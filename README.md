First for doing a clean work ...
Create a folder wherever you want to store this code ,with name you like .

Then create a file with (index.html) in your folder.

Then create another file named (main.css)  in your folder.

 (Remember you have to create above files in html and css extensions)
 
 Then download the (images.zip) file and unzip it  in your folder .
 
 And thats all you will be able to see the website.
 
 Thank you.....
